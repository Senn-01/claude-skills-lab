Notion for project management involves creating interconnected databases for Projects and Tasks, using custom Properties (Status, Due Date, Assignee) and varied Views (Kanban, Calendar, Timeline/Gantt) for visual tracking, and building personalized Dashboards with linked views to see relevant work in one place, allowing for flexible, centralized, and collaborative project organization from planning to execution. 
1. Core Setup: Databases & Relations
Projects Database: List your main projects with properties like Owner, Deadline, Status, & Team.
Tasks Database: List individual tasks, linking them to their parent project via a "Relation" property.
Properties: Add custom fields: Status (To Do, In Progress, Done), Due Date, Assignee, Priority, Files. 
This video provides a beginner-friendly, step-by-step tutorial on how to set up your Notion workspace:

2. Visualizing Work: Database Views
Kanban Board: Drag tasks through stages (columns).
Timeline/Gantt: Map tasks and dependencies over time.
Calendar View: See deadlines in a monthly/weekly layout.
Table View: A classic list for general overviews, often with filters like "My Tasks" or "Overdue". 

3. Central Hub: Dashboards & Views
Linked Databases: Create a main Dashboard page and use "Linked View of Database" to pull in filtered tasks from your main databases (e.g., "Today's Tasks," "This Week's Tasks").
Project Pages: Turn database entries into full pages for detailed notes, meeting minutes, and resources, creating a central hub for each project. 
This video will show you how to build a project plan and task tracker:

4. Collaboration & Automation
Sharing: Invite team members to specific pages or Teamspaces and set permissions.
Collaboration: Use @mentions, comments, and discussions directly on tasks and pages.
Automations: Set up rules (e.g., when status changes to "Done," notify the manager). 

5. Key Benefits
Unified Workspace: Combines docs, tasks, and knowledge.
Flexibility: Adapts to various methodologies (Agile, Sprint, etc.).
Customization: Build exactly what you need, from simple lists to complex systems. 
Next Steps
Start with a template or build from scratch using the basic database structure.
Experiment with properties and views to find what works best for your team.
Create a central dashboard for a high-level overview.
