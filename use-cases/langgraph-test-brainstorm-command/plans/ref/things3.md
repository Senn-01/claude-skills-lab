## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive productivity workflow using the **Things 3** application, as detailed by productivity expert Peter Akkies. The core methodology emphasizes a hierarchical structure distinguishing between **Areas of Responsibility** (ongoing domains like "Health" or "Business") and **Projects** (finite endeavors with specific goals). The workflow advocates for a "Today" view driven by proactive selection from an "Anytime" pool, ensuring daily focus is intentional rather than reactive.

Key features highlighted include the **Quick Entry** tool for friction-less capture, the **Someday** bucket for incubating ideas without cluttering active lists, and the use of **Templates** for recurring multi-step procedures. A critical component of the system is the **Weekly Review**, a ritualized maintenance session to process inboxes, audit lists, and plan the upcoming week. This guide transforms the visual tutorial into a structured manual for implementing a robust Getting Things Done (GTD)-style system within the Apple ecosystem.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**Things 3**: A task management application for Apple devices known for its minimalist design and strict adherence to GTD (Getting Things Done) principles. [Source: Industry standard]

**Area of Responsibility**: A high-level category representing an ongoing domain of life (e.g., "Health," "Finances") that has no completion date but requires continuous maintenance. [Source: Things 3 Documentation]

**Project**: A finite undertaking with a specific goal and deadline, composed of multiple steps (e.g., "Redesign Website"), which lives within an Area. [Source: Things 3 Documentation]

**Anytime View**: A list displaying all actionable tasks that are not blocked by start dates, effectively serving as a pool of "next actions" to choose from. [Source: Things 3 Documentation]

**Someday Bucket**: A storage location for ideas and tasks one is not yet committed to, keeping them out of the active workflow until they are ready for review. [Source: Derived from GTD methodology]

**Logbook**: An archive view in Things 3 that stores all completed tasks and projects, useful for reviewing past productivity and accomplishments. [Source: Things 3 Documentation]

**Quick Entry**: A system-wide keyboard shortcut (default: `Ctrl + Space`) that allows users to capture tasks from any application without opening the main Things 3 window. [Source: Tutorial Context]

**Weekly Review**: A dedicated planning session (typically weekly) used to process inboxes, update lists, and schedule upcoming tasks to ensure the system remains trusted and current. [Source: Tutorial Context]

**Templates**: A user-created workaround involving keeping a master copy of a project in the "Someday" list to duplicate for recurring standard operating procedures. [Source: Tutorial Context]

## Key Quotations

> "Things 3 is the to-do app with the best design... One of the cool things about Things is this structure of Areas. You can have tasks that live directly in an Area... but we've also got Projects such as each YouTube video... they also live in an Area."
> 
> — **Peter Akkies** (context: Explaining the fundamental hierarchy of the application)

> "This is a great way of making sure that I always get stuff done on time... If I don't do it any sooner than that, then on May 1st it will automatically get added to my Today view."
> 
> — **Peter Akkies** (context: Describing the "Upcoming" view's automation feature for scheduled tasks)

> "Projects bring you excitement, achievement, and recognition, whereas Areas bring you balance, peace, and meaning. Projects and Areas depend on each other at a deep level."
> 
> — **Peter Akkies** (context: Highlighting the philosophical distinction between finite goals and ongoing maintenance)

> "It is incredibly important to do what's called a weekly review... This is my way of reflecting on what I did in the past week, of making sure that all of my lists are up to date, and making sure that I have a plan going into the week."
> 
> — **Peter Akkies** (context: Emphasizing the maintenance habit required to keep the productivity system functional)

## 1. Interface and Structural Hierarchy

The Things 3 interface is divided into two primary panes: the **Sidebar** (navigation) and the **Main Content List** (tasks). Effective organization relies on a specific hierarchy:

* **Areas**: High-level containers for ongoing responsibilities (e.g., *Business, Health, Home, Admin & Finances*). These never "complete."
* **Projects**: Finite goals containing multiple steps (e.g., *Redesign Website, Plan Trip*). Projects typically reside *within* Areas.
* **Tasks**: Individual actionable items. These can live directly inside an Area (for isolated maintenance tasks) or within a Project.

### The "Today" View
The central hub for daily execution is the **Today** view. This list can be populated in two ways:
1.  **Manual Selection**: Dragging tasks from the "Anytime" view into "Today."
2.  **Automated Scheduling**: Tasks with assigned start dates automatically appear here when the date arrives.

**View Options**:
* **Grouped**: By default, tasks are grouped by their Area/Project.
* **Sorted**: Disabling "Group by Project/Area" in settings allows for manual reordering to create a linear "execution list" (e.g., chronological order of the day).

## 2. Task Management Workflows

### The "Anytime" Workflow
The **Anytime** view serves as a reservoir of all available tasks. It is distinct from the "Today" view in that it holds tasks that *can* be done but haven't yet been committed to for the current day.
* **Process**: Review the "Anytime" list each morning.
* **Action**: Select tasks to work on and move them to "Today" using the keyboard shortcut `Command + T` or by dragging.

### The "Someday" Incubator
The **Someday** list functions as a holding pen for ideas and potential projects that are not currently active.
* **Purpose**: Prevents active lists from becoming cluttered with "maybe" items.
* **Usage**: When an idea arises (e.g., "Redesign Website") but isn't a priority, it is sent to Someday using `Command + S`.
* **Review**: This list is audited periodically to promote items to active status or delete them.

### Handling Deadlines vs. Schedules
Things 3 distinguishes between *when* you want to do a task and *when* it is due.
* **Scheduled Dates**: Tasks set for a future date (e.g., May 1st) sit in the **Upcoming** view until that day, at which point they automatically move to "Today."
* **Hard Deadlines**: Using the Flag icon sets a deadline. The task remains visible but carries a deadline indicator.

## 3. Advanced Organization Techniques

### Converting Tasks to Projects
When a single task becomes too complex (e.g., "Redesign Website"), it should be converted into a Project to support multiple steps.
* **Action**: Right-click the task > select **Convert to Project**.
* **Result**: The item moves to the sidebar as a project, allowing for sub-tasks, headers, and detailed planning.

### Project Templates
Things 3 does not have a native "Template" feature, but this can be emulated for recurring projects (e.g., "Publishing a YouTube Video").
1.  Create a "Master" project with all standard steps in the **Someday** list (or a dedicated "Templates" Area).
2.  When needed, duplicate the project (`Command + C`, `Command + V`).
3.  Move the copy to the active Area and begin execution.

### Repeating Tasks
For maintenance tasks (e.g., "Prepare meeting agenda"), use the **Repeat** function.
* **Options**:
    * **Regular Intervals**: Repeat every X weeks/days.
    * **After Completion**: Repeat X days *after* the previous instance is checked off.
* **Visibility**: Future instances appear in the **Upcoming** view.

## 4. The Weekly Review Ritual

To prevent the system from becoming stale, a **Weekly Review** (recommended on Sundays) is essential.

**Process Checklist:**
1.  **Process Physical Inbox**: Clear paper mail, receipts, etc.
2.  **Process Digital Inboxes**: Clear Email, Slack, and the Things 3 Inbox.
    * Use **Quick Entry** (`Ctrl + Space`) throughout the week to capture inputs instantly.
3.  **Audit Active Lists**:
    * Check **Apple Notes/Reference** apps to ensure alignment with Things 3.
    * Review all **Areas** and **Projects**.
    * Update statuses (mark as complete, reschedule, or delete).
4.  **Forward Planning**:
    * Check the **Upcoming** view and **Calendar** events for the next week.
    * Pre-load the "Today" or "Scheduled" lists with critical tasks for the week ahead.

## 5. Hidden and Specialized Views

Things 3 contains several powerful views that are not immediately visible in the sidebar but can be accessed via search (`Command + F`) or specific menus.

| View Name | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deadlines** | Aggregates all tasks with hard deadlines, sorted by date. |
| **Logbook** | Shows a history of all completed tasks (useful for reporting/billing). |
| **Tomorrow** | A dedicated view for planning the immediate next day. |
| **Repeating** | Lists all active recurring task series. |
| **All Projects** | A high-level overview of every project across all Areas. |
| **Logged Projects** | An archive of fully completed projects. |

## 6. Conclusion

Things 3 is designed to balance structure with flexibility. By separating "Areas" (ongoing life maintenance) from "Projects" (achievable goals) and utilizing the "Today/Anytime/Someday" flow, users can maintain a "mind like water" state. The system's effectiveness relies heavily on the **Quick Entry** habit for capture and the **Weekly Review** for maintenance, ensuring the tool remains a reliable reflection of one's commitments.
